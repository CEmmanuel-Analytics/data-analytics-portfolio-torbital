# Torbital Analytics Portfolio Projects

This repository contains a collection of data analytics and machine learning projects I developed during practical training and self-led improvement. Each project reflects my ability to clean, analyze, model, and visualize data using tools like **Python** and **Power BI** core competencies for entry-level roles in data analytics and data science.


## Project Overviews

### 1.  **Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI)**
**File:** `Sales data set for torbital analysis.pbix`  
- Developed a dynamic, interactive dashboard in Power BI using sales data.
- Performed data modeling using relationships between sales, products, and store tables.
- Key visuals include:
  - Product category performance
  - Monthly sales trends
  - Gross profit by product
  - Store manager location ranking
- Implemented slicers for Year, Brand, and Payment Method to enhance user experience.

> **Tools Used:** Power BI, Data Modeling, DAX Measures, Interactive Reports



### 2.  **Data Analysis with Python – Sales Dataset**
**File:** `Torbital Assignment.ipynb`  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on transactional sales data.
- Cleaned and transformed raw data using pandas.
- Calculated key performance metrics such as total revenue, unit cost, and gross profit.
- Visualized results using bar charts, histograms, and trend lines.

> **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook


### 3. **Intro to Machine Learning – Classification Model**
**File:** `torbital assignment. Machine Learning intro.ipynb`  
- Built a basic classification model to predict categorical outcomes.
- Handled data preprocessing and applied Logistic Regression.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

> **Tools Used:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook
